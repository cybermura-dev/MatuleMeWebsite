### Key Components

**Layout Components:**
- `Header.tsx`: Navigation bar with logo, menu, and theme toggle
- `Footer.tsx`: Footer with additional links and information

**Section Components:**
- `Hero.tsx`: Main banner with headline, subheadline, and CTA
- `Features.tsx`: List of product features
- `WhyUs.tsx`: Section with unique advantages
- `AppShowcase.tsx`: Visual demonstration of the app/product
- `Reviews.tsx`: Client testimonials in a carousel
- `CallToAction.tsx`: Final call to action

**UI Components:**
- Basic components for creating interfaces (buttons, cards, input fields)
- Higher-order components for animations and effects

### Styling Approach

The project uses a combination of Tailwind CSS and CSS Modules:

- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility classes for quick styling
- **CSS Modules**: For more complex styles requiring specific logic
- **Global Styles**: In the `globals.css` file for basic settings

Dark/light theme is implemented using:
- CSS variables in `:root` and `[data-theme="dark"]`
- Tailwind CSS `dark:` modifier
- Local storage for saving user preferences

### Data Management

Data in the application is managed as follows:

- **Static Data**: In JSON files for reusable content
- **Component State**: Through React hooks (useState, useReducer)
- **Context**: For global state (e.g., for theme)

## Performance Optimization

### Image Optimization

- Automatic optimization through Next.js Image component
- WebP format generation for modern browsers
- Proper image sizing through size attributes
- Lazy loading for images outside the viewport

### Code Splitting

- Automatic code splitting at the page level
- Dynamic imports for heavy components
- Route-based splitting thanks to App Router

### Bundle Size Management

- Minimizing dependencies on external libraries
- Using tree-shaking to eliminate unused code
- Bundle analysis with `next bundle-analyzer`
